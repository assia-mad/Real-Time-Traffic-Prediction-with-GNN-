# Graph Neural Networks for Real-Time Traffic Prediction

## Overview

This project explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in the domain of real-time traffic prediction. The primary focus is on utilizing Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCN) to forecast traffic flow efficiently.
